<p><b>Bulbasaur</b> (<a href="/wiki/List_of_Japanese_Pok%C3%A9mon_names" title="List of Japanese Pokémon names">Japanese</a>: <b>フシギダネ</b> <i>Fushigidane</i>) is a dual-type <a href="/wiki/Grass_(type)" title="Grass (type)">Grass</a>/<a href="/wiki/Poison_(type)" title="Poison (type)">Poison</a> Pokémon.

</p><p>Along with <a href="/wiki/Charmander_(Pok%C3%A9mon)" title="Charmander (Pokémon)">Charmander</a> and <a href="/wiki/Squirtle_(Pok%C3%A9mon)" title="Squirtle (Pokémon)">Squirtle</a>, Bulbasaur is one of three <a href="/wiki/Starter_Pok%C3%A9mon" title="Starter Pokémon">starter Pokémon</a> of <a href="/wiki/Kanto" title="Kanto">Kanto</a> available at the beginning of <a href="/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Green_Versions" title="Pokémon Red and Green Versions">Pokémon Red, Green</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue_Versions" title="Pokémon Red and Blue Versions">Blue</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen_Versions" title="Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions">FireRed, and LeafGreen</a>.
</p><p>Bulbasaur is a small, quadruped Pokémon with green or bluish-green skin and dark patches. Its thick legs each end with three sharp claws. Its eyes have red irises, while the sclera and pupils are white. Bulbasaur has a pair of small, pointed teeth visible when its mouth is open. It has a bulb on its back, grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.
</p><p>As mentioned <a href="/wiki/AG025" title="AG025">in the anime</a>, starter Pokémon are raised by <a href="/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Breeder_(Trainer_class)" title="Pokémon Breeder (Trainer class)">Breeders</a> to be distributed to new <a href="/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trainer" title="Pokémon Trainer">Trainers</a>. Having been domesticated from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokémon. <a href="/wiki/EP102" title="EP102">It is known</a> to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment. <a href="/wiki/PK01" title="PK01">Bulbasaur has also shown</a> itself to be an excellent caretaker, even having a special technique called the "Bulba-by." To perform this technique, Bulbasaur uses its vines to pick up a young Pokémon and soothingly rocks the young one in the air.
</p><p>It is found in <a href="/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_habitat#Grassland_Pok.C3.A9mon" title="List of Pokémon by habitat">grasslands</a> and forests throughout the Kanto region. However, due to Bulbasaur's status as starter Pokémon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. <a href="/wiki/EP051" title="EP051">It has been observed</a> that a Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation. Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to become Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.
</p><p>Ash's Bulbasaur debuted in <i><a href="/wiki/EP010" title="EP010">Bulbasaur and the Hidden Village</a></i> as one of the Pokémon in the <a href="/wiki/Hidden_Village" title="Hidden Village">Hidden Village</a>. Though initially wary of <a href="/wiki/Ash_Ketchum" title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a>, the two eventually warmed up to one another, and Bulbasaur challenged him to a battle. Using <a href="/wiki/Ash%27s_Pikachu" title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a>, Ash won the battle, and Bulbasaur was captured. Unlike <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ash%27s_Charmander" title="Ash's Charmander">Charmander</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ash%27s_Squirtle" title="Ash's Squirtle">Squirtle</a>, which were captured in the two episodes following that of Bulbasaur, Bulbasaur remained in Ash's party until <i><a href="/wiki/EP225" title="EP225">Bulbasaur... the Ambassador!</a></i>, when Ash sent him to <a href="/wiki/Professor_Oak_(anime)" title="Professor Oak (anime)">Professor Oak</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Professor_Oak%27s_Laboratory" title="Professor Oak's Laboratory">lab</a> to work as an ambassador between otherwise argumentative groups of Pokémon.
</p><p>Much later on, when Ash was traveling in the <a href="/wiki/Hoenn" title="Hoenn">Hoenn</a> region, his companion <a href="/wiki/May_(anime)" title="May (anime)">May</a> captured her own Bulbasaur after being separated from the group in <i><a href="/wiki/AG073" title="AG073">Grass Hysteria!</a></i>. It remained with her throughout the rest of her journey in Hoenn, helping her to compete in the <a href="/wiki/Hoenn_Grand_Festival" title="Hoenn Grand Festival">regional</a> <a href="/wiki/Grand_Festival" title="Grand Festival">Grand Festival</a>. When she traveled to <a href="/wiki/Kanto" title="Kanto">Kanto</a> to continue her journey with Ash in <i><a href="/wiki/AG133" title="AG133">The Right Place and the Right Mime</a></i>, May, too, left her Bulbasaur at Professor Oak's lab to learn from Ash's while she and Ash's group traveled throughout the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Battle_Frontier_(Hoenn)" title="Battle Frontier (Hoenn)">Battle Frontier</a> in Kanto. May retrieved it during her travels in <a href="/wiki/Johto" title="Johto">Johto</a>, where it evolved all the way into a <a href="/wiki/Venusaur_(Pok%C3%A9mon)" title="Venusaur (Pokémon)">Venusaur</a>.
</p><p>A Bulbasaur that used to belong to the <a href="/wiki/Mayor_of_Trovitopolis" title="Mayor of Trovitopolis">Mayor of Trovitopolis</a> appeared in <i><a href="/wiki/EP102" title="EP102">The Mystery Menace</a></i>. In his childhood, the mayor abandoned his Bulbasaur and sent it into the sewers when it wouldn't evolve into <a href="/wiki/Ivysaur_(Pok%C3%A9mon)" title="Ivysaur (Pokémon)">Ivysaur</a>. Aided by <a href="/wiki/Misty" title="Misty">Misty</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tracey_Sketchit" title="Tracey Sketchit">Tracey</a>, Ash found the abandoned Bulbasaur while searching for his own, which had gone missing. After defeating the arrogant mayor and his personal SWAT team, Ash and company left the Bulbasaur, which had grown rather large in its time in the sewers, with <a href="/wiki/Nurse_Joy" title="Nurse Joy">Nurse Joy</a>.
</p><p>In <i><a href="/wiki/SS014" title="SS014">Journey to the Starting Line</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_(Kanto)" title="Gilbert (Kanto)">Gilbert</a>, the son of the mayor of <a href="/wiki/Pallet_Town" title="Pallet Town">Pallet Town</a>, was supposed to start his journey as a <a href="/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trainer" title="Pokémon Trainer">Pokémon Trainer</a> with one of the three Kanto starter Pokémon, but they were scared off by <a href="/wiki/Ash%27s_Tauros" title="Ash's Tauros">Ash's Tauros</a>. <a href="/wiki/Professor_Oak_(anime)" title="Professor Oak (anime)">Professor Oak</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tracey_Sketchit" title="Tracey Sketchit">Tracey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Delia_Ketchum" title="Delia Ketchum">Delia</a>, and Gilbert set out to find them. The Bulbasaur was the last one to be found and it was stuck in a tree that was surrounded by a group of <a href="/wiki/Primeape_(Pok%C3%A9mon)" title="Primeape (Pokémon)">Primeape</a>. In the end, Bulbasaur was the one that Gilbert decided to start with.

</p><p>Bulbasaur was mentioned in the first episode of the anime, <i><a href="/wiki/EP001" title="EP001">Pokémon - I Choose You!</a></i>, as one of the three <a href="/wiki/Starter_Pok%C3%A9mon" title="Starter Pokémon">starter Pokémon</a> new Trainers in <a href="/wiki/Pallet_Town" title="Pallet Town">Pallet Town</a> can choose from. Ash dreamed of owning one, and it was his second choice of a starter, after <a href="/wiki/Squirtle_(Pok%C3%A9mon)" title="Squirtle (Pokémon)">Squirtle</a>. However, when he arrived at Oak's lab, it was too late, as an unnamed Trainer who started the same day had already taken it.

</p><p>One Bulbasaur figure has been released.
</p><p>Bulbasaur appears as a random trophy.
</p><p><i>Bulbasaur is a cute Pokémon born with a large seed firmly affixed to its back; the seed grows in size as the Pokémon does. Along with Squirtle and Charmander, Bulbasaur is one of the three Pokémon available at the beginning of Pokémon Red and Blue. It evolves into Ivysaur.</i>
</p><p><i>"A Seed Pokémon. From birth, Bulbasaur carries a large plant seed on its back. It uses the nutrients from the seed to grow bigger and bigger. Extended exposure to the sun will cause its body and seed to grow in size. Some say that once, when the seed was much lighter, Bulbasaur was able to get around on two legs. Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur."</i>
</p><p><br clear="all"/>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>Bulbasaur appears to be based primarily on some form of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reptile" title="wp:reptile">reptile</a>, specifically mammal-like reptiles known as <i><a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicynodonts" title="wp:Dicynodonts">Dicynodonts</a></i> from the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian" title="wp:Permian">Permian</a> period. Along with visible ears and no genuine metamorphosis stage (evolution aside), Bulbasaur appears to have more in common with <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mammals" title="wp:mammals">mammals</a> than <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amphibians" title="wp:amphibians">amphibians</a> like <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frogs" title="wp:frogs">frogs</a> and <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toads" title="wp:toads">toads</a>, which metamorphose from one definite creature into another as they mature as opposed to just growing into a larger adult version of itself the way that Bulbasaur does. Alternatively, Bulbasaur's large rounded snout, wide mouth, wide-set eyes, blotch-patterned skin, and quadraped-like movements are vaguely similar to those of certain amphibians, such as the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_toad" title="wp:common toad">common toad</a>. Since Bulbasaur's "ears" do not in fact have hollows, they may actually be similar to the glands present behind the eyes of many species of frogs and toads.
</p><p>The bulb on its back may resemble that of a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lily" title="wp:lily">lily</a> or <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/onion" title="wp:onion">onion</a>.
</p><p>Bulbasaur is a portmanteau of the words <i><a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulb" title="wp:bulb">bulb</a></i> (a rounded underground storage organ present in some plants, notably those of the lily family) and the Greek <i>saur</i> (lizard).
</p><p>Fushigidane literally means "<i>isn't it strange?</i>" and is also a pun on 不思議種 <i>fushigidane</i> (mysterious bulb).
