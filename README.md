## Timeline

Todo:
  - Parse data into lunr
   - Each 'Pokemon' should be a document with:
     - Raw wiki data
     - Pokeapi entry
    - Parse both as raw text?
     - Apply tokenizer to raw strings
     - Apply trimmer, stemmer & stopword filter
     - Add document for both

  - Keyword searching
   - Use tokenizer
  - Top result and 3 of next-relevant results
  - [x] Retrieve text from each Pokemon's wiki page
  - [x] Retrieve info from each Pokemon's entry in pokeapi

 - [x] Voice recognition for search
  - Just need to add javascript to enable
 
 - [x] Make template for pokemon result page
  - [x] Top result is returned if within threshold (>0.7 or so)
